#Week 1: Descriptives and graph

<!-- 1) Move your data into a long format and a wide format. Did you have any specific challenges that you encountered? If so, discuss them. -->

<!-- 2) Create a wave variable and date variable (if applicable). -->

<!-- 3) What is your sample size for each wave of assessment? -->

<!-- 4) Take the date variable and convert it to a different date format such as time in study or age (if appropriate). What scale is most suitable for your analyses? (weeks/months/years?) -->

<!-- 5) Graph your data using the different time metrics, fitting individual curves for each person. -->

<!-- 6) Create an overall average trend of your data (split up into groups if appropriate). Attempt to color your individual data points and/or shade different lines (highlight some particiapnts, highlight the average trend line but not the individual level lines) -->

<!-- 7) Look at the correlations of your DV across time -->
